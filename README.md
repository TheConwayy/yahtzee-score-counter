Yahtzee Score Counter
=====================
A nice and simple script to keep your Yahtzee scores.

## About the project

While playing Yahtzee with some family, I realized that keeping score in Yahtzee can be a challenge. So, I decided that I would create this script so that it is easier for you to add up them scores at the end.

Basically, this is a humna calculator

## Furture plans for the project

- Create a website made with React *(because I need to learn it)*
- Make it so that it goes through the whole round, instead of just the end

## Getting started
